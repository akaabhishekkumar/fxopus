<h1>Security Policy</h1>

<h2>1. Accountability</h2>
<p>By joining our services, you certify that all information you provide, now and in the future, is accurate. FXOpus reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to deny you access to this website and our services, without notice, for the following reasons:</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Immediately by FXOpus for any unauthorized access or use by you;</li>
    <li>Immediately by FXOpus if you assign or misuse (or attempt to misuse) the information we share with you;</li>
    <li>Immediately if you violate any of the other terms and conditions of the Service Contract.</li>
</ol>
<p>By using our services, I agree to receive WhatsApp alerts and newsletters from FXOpus.</p>

<h2>2. Information Collections and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Organization information must be protected against unauthorized activity, tampering, loss, and destruction, wherever it is found, in a manner consistent with applicable laws and with the information’s significance to the Organization and any individual whose information is collected. To achieve this, Organization information will be segregated into logical collections (e.g., Client personal data, employee benefit data, payroll data, and financial records). Each collection must be associated with an individual known as an “Information Guardian” who is responsible for:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Defining the collection’s requirements for confidentiality, integrity, availability, and security.</li>
    <li>Conveying the collection’s requirements in writing to the managers of departments that will have access to it.</li>
    <li>Working with Office Heads to determine which users, groups, roles, or job functions are authorized to access the information in the collection and in what manner (e.g., who can view or update the information).</li>
</ol>
<p>The guardian of a logical information collection is typically the head of the department on whose behalf the information is collected or that is most closely associated with it. Each Information Guardian may designate one or more individuals on their staff to perform these duties; however, the Information Guardian retains ultimate responsibility for their actions.</p>

<h2>3. Responsibilities of Department Heads</h2>
<p>Department Heads are required to:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Understand the security-related requirements for the information collections used within their respective departments by working with the appropriate Information Guardians.</li>
    <li>Develop and ensure adherence to procedures that support the objectives for confidentiality, integrity, availability, and security as defined by the Information Guardians.</li>
    <li>Effectively communicate any restrictions to those who use, administer, process, store, or transfer the information in any form, physical or electronic.</li>
    <li>Ensure that each staff member understands their information security-related responsibilities and acknowledges their intent to comply with these requirements.</li>
    <li>Report any evidence that information has been compromised or any suspicious activity to the Organization's IT Security Office.</li>
</ol>

<h2>4. Client Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Clients are required not to misuse the information shared with them by our organization. It should only be used for the agreed-upon context and no other purpose.</p>

<h2>5. Implementation</h2>
<p>We will implement the provisions of this policy and ensure that staff who handle or have access to personal information are fully familiar with it.</p>

<h2>6. Monitoring</h2>
<p>We will check that the policy is being implemented (e.g., by conducting periodic audits of data protection procedures) and identify any issues that arise.</p>

<h2>7. Review, Evaluation, and Revision</h2>
<p>We will review and evaluate the impact of this policy at predetermined times, taking into account feedback and other developments, and revise it as necessary.</p>

<h2>8. Penalty Norms</h2>
<p>Direct termination of service will occur if anyone is found to be violating these norms.</p>

<h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
<p>All employees of FXOpus, including those working from home or carrying systems out of the office, must adhere to the IT Data Privacy policy. They must ensure all confidential information, such as client names, contact numbers, and any personal client information, remains within FXOpus only. All employees are restricted from taking client personal data or documents in any medium (e.g., electronic media, printed copy) outside the Organization's premises.</p>
