<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
<p>FXOpus is an independent, full-service, client-centric consultancy and digital solutions firm. Our objective is to provide unbiased advice and service to both individual and institutional clients using a wide range of digital instruments. FXOpus is backed by a team of visionary and zealous individuals who work together to provide a wide range of services to a substantial and diversified client base.</p>

<h2>1. License</h2>
<p>FXOpus hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable, and non-transferable license to access our services, provided and expressly conditioned upon your agreement that all such access and use shall be governed by all of the terms and conditions set forth in this User Agreement.</p>

<h2>2. Copyright & No Retransmission of Information</h2>
<p>The design and information contained in this site are the valuable and exclusive property of FXOpus, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as transferring or assigning any such ownership rights to you or any other person or entity. All information provided by FXOpus is proprietary and confidential and cannot be repeated for any reason outside of our services. You agree not to repeat or rebroadcast in any way any of the recommendations made by FXOpus for any reason whatsoever. You agree that if you do repeat or re-post any of our recommendations by any means, you will be liable for actual and punitive damages as determined by FXOpus and additional damages to be determined by an Indian court of Law. You may not resell, redistribute, broadcast, or transfer the information or use it in a searchable, machine-readable database unless separately and specifically authorized in writing by FXOpus prior to such use. You may not rent, lease, sublicense, distribute, transfer, copy, reproduce, publicly display, publish, adapt, store, or time-share our services, any part thereof, or any of the information received or accessed therefrom to or through any other person or entity unless separately and specifically authorized in writing by FXOpus prior to such use. In addition, you may not remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, legal, or proprietary notices in or on any portions of our services without prior written authorization. Any other use of the information contained in this site requires the prior written consent of FXOpus and may require a separate fee.</p>

<h2>3. Delays in Services</h2>
<p>Neither FXOpus (including its directors, employees, affiliates, agents, representatives, or subcontractors) shall be liable for any loss or liability resulting, directly or indirectly, from delays or interruptions due to electronic or mechanical equipment failures, telephone interconnect problems, defects, weather, strikes, walkouts, fire, acts of God, riots, armed conflicts, acts of war, or other like causes. FXOpus shall have no responsibility to provide you access to its services while interruption is due to any such cause.</p>

<h2>4. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
<p>You expressly agree that use of the website is at your sole risk. The contents, information, and services published on this website may include inaccuracies or typographical errors. Changes are periodically added to the contents herein. FXOpus and/or its respective suppliers may make improvements and/or changes to this website at any time. This website may be temporarily unavailable from time to time due to required maintenance, telecommunication interruptions, or other disruptions. FXOpus (and its owners, suppliers, consultants, advertisers, affiliates, partners, employees, or any other associated entities, all collectively referred to as "associated entities" hereafter) shall not be liable to any user, member, or third party should FXOpus exercise its right to modify or discontinue any or all of the contents, information, software, products, features, and services published on this website. FXOpus and/or its respective associated entities make no representations about the suitability of the contents, information, software, products, features, and services contained on this website for any purpose. All such contents are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. FXOpus and/or its associated entities hereby disclaim all warranties and conditions with regard to these contents, including all implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and availability. In no event shall FXOpus and/or its associated entities be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of or in any way connected with the use of this website or with the delay or inability to use this website, or for any contents, information, software, products, features, and services obtained through this website, or otherwise arising out of the use of this website, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise, even if FXOpus or any of its associated entities has been advised of the possibility of damages.</p>

<h2>5. Working Discipline</h2>
<p>FXOpus strictly follows a Working Principle and Stop Loss Policy wherein the Client, by default, agrees not to enter any trade without a pre-informed or defined Stop Loss. If you trade against the stop-loss policy, you alone shall be responsible for the consequences, and FXOpus shall have zero liability. We further advise that you do not trade on recommendations of employees outside the course of their employment. If you do so, the liability will be your own, and FXOpus shall not be accountable for any loss. The "lifetime service" mentioned in services will include services for up to 5 years from the date of the start of the service and will be given only to the person who has paid for it (services will not be delivered to any family or friends of the client). If a client wants to stop the service, it will be stopped immediately upon their request, but in no case will a refund be given.</p>

<h2>6. Refund & Cancellation Policy</h2>
<p>All sales are final. We do not offer any Free Look-up Period. Any refund request sent on subsequent dates after the payment from clients will not be entertained. After a client agrees to pay and join our services, no refunds will be given under any conditions. The client has paid after having a discussion with our team and potentially after a free trial, so in any case, no refunds will be given. Trading comes with a risk of loss, and we do not guarantee profits in this market. We never commit to 100% accuracy or returns, so please do not expect that. A contract received via any social media platform will not be valid in any scenario. You can send mail to us at support@fxopus.com from your registered email ID.</p>

<h2>7. Equipment and Operation</h2>
<p>You shall provide and maintain all internet and other equipment necessary to access our services, and the costs of any such equipment and/or connections, including any applicable taxes, shall be borne solely by you. You are responsible for operating your own equipment used to access our services.</p>

<h2>8. Information Disclaimer</h2>
<p>You acknowledge that the information provided through FXOpus is compiled from sources that are beyond our control. Though such information is recognized by the parties to be generally reliable, the parties acknowledge that inaccuracies may occur, and FXOpus does not warrant the consistency or suitability of the information. For this reason, as well as the possibility of human and mechanical errors and other factors, you acknowledge that our service is provided to you on an "as is, with all faults" basis. FXOpus expressly disclaims any and all warranties, whether express, oral, implied, statutory, or otherwise, of any kind to the users and/or any third party, including any implied warranties of consistency, timeliness, completeness, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose, as well as any warranties arising by virtue of custom of service or course of dealing and any implied warranties of title or non-infringement. In addition, FXOpus, in providing the information, makes no endorsement of any particular security, market participant, or brokerage. Further, FXOpus does not represent or warrant that it will meet your requirements or is suitable for your needs.</p>
<p>Under this User Agreement, you assume all risk of errors and/or omissions in our service, including the transmission or translation of information.

Any clause declared invalid shall be deemed severable and not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder. These terms may only be amended in a writing signed by FXOpus.</p>

<h2>10. Conflicting Terms</h2>
<p>If there is any conflict between this User Agreement and other documents, this User Agreement shall govern, whether such other documents are prior to or subsequent to this User Agreement, or are signed or acknowledged by any director, officer, employee, representative, or agent of FXOpus.</p>

<h2>11. Entire Agreement</h2>
<p>This User Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties, and no other agreement, written or oral, exists between you and FXOpus. By using the information from FXOpus, you assume full responsibility for any and all gains and losses, financial, emotional, or otherwise, experienced, suffered, or incurred by you. The service is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including without limitation, any warranty for information, data, services, uninterrupted access, or products provided through or in connection with the service. Specifically, FXOpus disclaims any and all warranties, including, but not limited to: (i) any warranties concerning the availability, consistency, usefulness, or content of information or services; and (ii) any warranties of title, warranty of non-infringement, and warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. This disclaimer of liability applies to any damages or injury caused by any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus, communication line failure, theft or destruction, or unauthorized access to, alteration of, or use of record, whether for breach of contract, tort, negligence, or under any other cause of action. Neither FXOpus nor any of its employees or agents shall be liable to you or any other third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of use of service or inability to gain access to or use the service or out of any breach of any warranty. Further, you agree and understand that all services provided are non-refundable and that you should carefully consider whether our services are able to meet your needs.</p>

<h2>12. Termination</h2>
<p>This User Agreement and the license rights granted hereunder shall remain in full force and effect unless terminated or canceled for any of the following reasons: (a) immediately by FXOpus for any unauthorized access or use by you; (b) immediately by FXOpus if you assign or transfer (or attempt the same) any rights granted to you under this Agreement; (c) immediately if you violate any of the other terms and conditions of this User Agreement. Termination or cancellation of this Agreement shall not affect any right or relief to which FXOpus may be entitled, at law or in equity. Upon termination of this User Agreement, all rights granted to you will terminate and revert to FXOpus. Except as set forth herein, regardless of the reason for cancellation or termination of this User Agreement, the fee charged, if any, for access to our services is non-refundable for any reason.</p>

<h2>13. Dispute Settlement</h2>
<p>All disputes, differences, and questions of any nature which at any time arise between the parties to this agreement out of the construction of or concerning anything contained in or arising out of this agreement or as to the rights, duties, or liabilities under it or the parties to it shall be referred to a sole Arbitrator under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The sole Arbitrator shall be appointed by the Managing Director of FXOpus. The Arbitration Proceedings shall be held at Noida (Uttar Pradesh), India. The Place of Arbitration will be at Noida (Uttar Pradesh), India. The laws prevailing in India shall alone apply to the Arbitration Proceedings between the parties.</p>
