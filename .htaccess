# Rule 1: Force Clean URLs (External Redirect)
# If a request comes in for a file that ends in .html,
# permanently redirect the browser to the version without .html.
# This is for SEO and for users who might have old bookmarks.

# Rule 2: Handle Clean URLs (Internal Rewrite)
# If a request comes in for a URL that does not exist as a file or directory,
# check if a file with that name plus .html exists.
# If it does, serve that .html file silently without changing the URL.
